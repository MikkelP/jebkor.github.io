### Stay a while, and listen

My name is Jesper Brinch Korsbakke, or also known as "jebkor".

As stated on the frontpage of my blog, I am a frontend developer. I have an immense interest in the industry and a day dooesn't go by, where I'm catching up on either Reddit or some other news site.

I do frontend development, but have an interest in the design and user-experience as well. I find it's very important areas in any application for website, that's user driven.

Besides me doing frontend development, I also try to do other things. Such other things could be, but are not limited to:
* Running
* CrossFit
* Gaming
* Watching shows

I find that in an industry that is very sedatary, it's important to keep the body going and treating it well. Running has been a way for me to keep myself healthy and for me to meditate during rough times.

I've recently started doing CrossFit. Not ''real'' CrossFit with snatches, jerks, clean hangs... *continues forever with CrossFit jargon, that no-one understands anyways*.

Besides that, I like to do some good ol' gaming. Be it video games, tabletop games or any other kind of games, I'm in. I am a nerd anyways ðŸ˜Š

I think those are the most important details about me for you to get a good idea about, who I am. If you have questions about me, feel free to either send me a mail or shoot a DM on twitter, then I will try to answer to the best of my abilities.
